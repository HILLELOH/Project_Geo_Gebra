Representation: A line segment AB is defined by its two endpoints:
A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) on the Cartesian grid.
It represents a finite straight line between A and B.
The segment's length can be calculated using the distance formula:
sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).

For calculate the formula of a finite segment, 
y = m(X-x1)+ y1 or y = m(X-x2)+ y2
Line segments are essential for:
constructing more complex shapes and measuring distances within them.
