Representation: A polygon is represented by a series of vertices (points)
connected by straight line segments.

Each vertex is denoted as P(x, y) where,
(x, y) are its coordinates on the Cartesian grid.
The vertices are ordered in sequence to form the sides of the polygon.
A polygon with n sides is called an n-gon. 

To calculate the area of a polygon, the Shoelace formula is used.
For a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, 
while a non-convex polygon may have interior angles greater than 180 degrees.

Triangulation is a method to divide a polygon into triangles, simplifying calculations and analyses.

A convex hull is a fundamental concept in computational geometry.
Given a set of points in a two-dimensional (2D) space, 
the convex hull is the smallest convex polygon (2D) that contains all the given points.

In other words, it is the smallest shape that 
encloses all the points while having no indentations or "dents."

Polygons are fundamental in geometry and find applications
in various fields, including computer graphics, geography, and architecture.
